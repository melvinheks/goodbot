Sentiment provides several things:\n\n- Performance (see benchmarks below)\n- The ability to append and overwrite word / value pairs from the AFINN wordlist\n- A build process that makes updating sentiment to future wordlists trivial\n\n### Installation\n```bash\nnpm install sentiment\n```\n\n### Usage\n```javascript\nvar sentiment = require('sentiment');\n\nvar r1 = sentiment('Cats are stupid.');\nconsole.dir(r1);        // Score: -2, Comparative: -0.666\n\nvar r2 = sentiment('Cats are totally amazing!');\nconsole.dir(r2);        // Score: 4, Comparative: 1\n```\n\n### Adding / overwriting words\nYou can append and/or overwrite values from AFINN by simply injecting key/value pairs into a sentiment method call:\n```javascript\nvar sentiment = require('sentiment');\n\nvar result = sentiment('Cats are totally amazing!', {\n    'cats': 5,\n    'amazing': 2  \n});\nconsole.dir(result);    // Score: 7, Comparative: 1.75\n```\n\n---\n\n### Benchmarks\nA primary motivation for designing `sentiment` was performance. As such, it includes a benchmark script within the test directory that compares it against the [Sentimental](https://github.com/thinkroth/Sentimental) module which provides a nearly equivalent interface and approach. Based on these benchmarks, running on a MacBook Pro with Node v6.9.1, `sentiment` is **twice as fast** as alternative implementations:\n\n```bash\nsentiment (Latest) x 448,788 ops/sec ±1.02% (88 runs sampled)\nSentimental (1.0.1) x 240,103 ops/sec ±5.13% (81 runs sampled)\n```\n\nTo run the benchmarks yourself:\n```bash\nmake benchmark\n```\n\n---\n\n### Validation\nWhile the accuracy provided by AFINN is quite good considering it's computational performance (see above) there is always room for improvement. Therefore the `sentiment` module is open to accepting PRs which modify or amend the AFINN / Emoji datasets or implementation given that they improve accuracy and maintain similar performance characteristics. In order to establish this, we test the `sentiment` module against [three labelled datasets provided by UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences).\n\nTo run the validation tests yourself:\n```bash\nmake validate\n```\n\n#### Rand Accuracy (AFINN Only)\n```\nAmazon:  0.70\nIMDB:    0.76\nYelp:    0.67\n```\n\n#### Rand Accuracy (AFINN + Additions)\n```\nAmazon:  0.72 (+2%)\nIMDB:    0.76 (+0%)\nYelp:    0.69 (+2%)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Testing\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n",
